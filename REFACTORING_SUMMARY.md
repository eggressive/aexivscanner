# AEX Scanner Refactoring Summary

## Objective
Refactored the AEX scanner codebase to use a single source of truth for ticker symbols, with:
- `amsterdam_aex_tickers.csv` as the primary source of ticker data
- `tickers.json` as a backup option

## Completed Changes

### 1. Improved `aex_tickers.py` module as the central ticker provider
- Updated `load_tickers()` to prioritize loading from CSV file first
- Added proper error handling and detailed diagnostics
- Implemented CSV file parsing with comment handling
- Added backup functionality through JSON file
- Created CLI options to check ticker sources and update JSON

### 2. Enhanced ticker management and diagnostics
- Added `check_ticker_source()` to provide detailed information about ticker sources
- Improved `update_json_from_csv()` function to maintain backups of ticker data
- Added `--investigate` option to help diagnose problematic tickers

### 3. Improved `update_tickers.py` for better ticker handling
- Removed hardcoded ticker lists in favor of loading from CSV
- Added special case handling through `TICKER_SPECIAL_CASES` mapping dictionary
- Improved validation logic for problematic tickers
- Enhanced error messages to guide users when ticker sources can't be found

### 4. Updated `euronext_tickers.py` to work with new model
- Made it populate the CSV file as the primary source of truth
- Added functionality to update the JSON backup file automatically
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 5. Added investigation tools
- Created better diagnostic messages throughout the codebase
- Made the investigation tool more comprehensive

## Test Results
- Successfully verified that tickers are properly loaded from the CSV file
- Confirmed that the backup mechanism works when CSV is unavailable
- Special case handling for problematic tickers is working correctly
- CLI tools provide useful diagnostics and management options

## Benefits
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All components now share the same ticker data source
2. **Better Maintainability**: Easier to update ticker data across the entire system
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Clear error messages and diagnostics
4. **Special Case Support**: Proper handling of problematic tickers
5. **Better Documentation**: CLI options and code comments explain the system design

## Usage
- `python aex_tickers.py --check` to verify ticker sources
- `python aex_tickers.py --update-json` to update JSON from CSV data
- `python aex_tickers.py --investigate` to diagnose problematic tickers
- `python euronext_tickers.py` to refresh ticker data from Euronext
