# AEX IV Scanner - TODOs

## Future Enhancements

1. ✅ Refactor FAIR_VALUE_ESTIMATES storage
   - Moved FAIR_VALUE_ESTIMATES from aex_scanner.py to fair_values_config.json
   - Implemented automatic loading mechanism in aex_scanner.py via config_manager.py
   - Created dedicated configuration management with validation
   - Added support for multiple data sources:
     - Manual values (highest priority)
     - DCF calculation values
     - Yahoo Finance analyst targets
   - Implemented priority system for fair value sources

## Completed Enhancements

1. ✅ Calculate simplified DCF model as a Python function
   - Implemented DCF calculation based on:
     - Current free cash flow
     - Expected growth rate
     - Discount rate (WACC)
     - Terminal growth rate
   - Added this as an alternative fair value source
   - Implemented multiple valuation methods for different company types:
     - FCF-based DCF for normal companies
     - Earnings-based valuation for financial stocks
     - Price-to-Book valuation as fallback for financial stocks
     - P/E multiple as last resort fallback
   - Added integration with AEX scanner via dcf_integration.py
   - Added report generation capabilities

## More Completed Enhancements

1. ✅ Implement robust error handling for Yahoo Finance API
   - Added exponential backoff with jitter for rate limiting
   - Implemented automatic retries for connection issues
   - Added comprehensive data validation
   - Created detailed error logging and reporting
   - Built a diagnostic tool (`validate_ticker.py`) for troubleshooting

2. ✅ Create a single source of truth for AEX stock tickers
   - Ticker data is now stored in amsterdam_aex_tickers.csv with tickers.json as backup
   - All modules read from this common data source via aex_tickers.py
   - Ensures consistent ticker lists across the application
   - Simplifies adding/removing stocks from the scanner

3. ✅ Remove hardcoded file paths from JSON files
   - Removed filepath comments from tickers.json
   - Updated update_tickers.py to not add filepath comments
   - Ensured all modules use relative paths consistently

4. ✅ Investigate ticker validation errors in update_tickers.py
   - Replaced TICKER_SPECIAL_CASES with direct data from Euronext
   - Added new test_ticker_validation.py tool for comprehensive testing
   - Enhanced validation with improved retry logic
   - Updated documentation with troubleshooting steps

5. ✅ Investigate possibility to download fair value estimates for free
   - Implemented fair_value_updater.py to use Yahoo Finance analyst targets
   - Integrated automated updates for fair values in aex_scanner.py
   - Created backup mechanisms for fair value data

6. ✅ Refactor ticker management to use a single source of truth
   - Made `amsterdam_aex_tickers.csv` the primary source for ticker data
   - Configured `tickers.json` as a backup source only
   - Enhanced error handling and diagnostics in `aex_tickers.py`
   - Updated all modules to use the centralized ticker management system

7. ✅ Fix ticker validation and special case handling
   - Removed `TICKER_SPECIAL_CASES` mappings from `update_tickers.py`
   - Modified validation logic to rely on Euronext data directly
   - Updated documentation with the new approach

8. ✅ Improve ticker validation testing capabilities
   - Refactored `test_ticker_validation.py` to accept command line parameters
   - Added `--all` parameter to test all tickers from CSV file
   - Added `--verbose` option to show detailed ticker information
   - Added `--wait` parameter to control delay between API calls
   - Improved output formatting with success/failure summaries
