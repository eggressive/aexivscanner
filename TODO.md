2. ðŸ”„ Implement a Web Interface
   - Create a simple Flask/FastAPI web dashboard to visualize scanner results
   - Add interactive charts to explore valuation metrics
   - Include a configuration panel to adjust fair value sources and priorities

3. ðŸ”„ Enhance DCF Model Capabilities
   - Add sensitivity analysis for key DCF parameters (growth rate, discount rate)
   - Incorporate sector-specific valuation models
   - Create visualizations for DCF component breakdowns

4. ðŸ”„ Add Historical Tracking
   - Store historical fair value and price data over time
   - Implement visualization of valuation changes
   - Create alerts for significant valuation changes

5. ðŸ”„ Optimize Code Structure
   - Refactor duplicate code in different validation scripts
   - Standardize error handling and logging across modules
   - Consider packaging the application for easier distribution



## Additional Enhancement Recommendations

1. ðŸ”„ Implement Unit Testing Framework
   - Add pytest infrastructure for automated testing
   - Create test cases for core functionality (DCF calculation, fair value prioritization)
   - Add test coverage reporting
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

2. ðŸ”„ Enhance Visualization Capabilities
   - Add interactive Plotly/Bokeh charts instead of static matplotlib
   - Implement technical analysis indicators (moving averages, RSI, etc.)
   - Create correlation analysis between fair value accuracy and market movements
   - Add export functionality to various formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)

3. ðŸ”„ Expand Market Coverage
   - Extend beyond AEX to include other European exchanges (DAX, CAC40)
   - Create modular exchange adapters to handle different market conventions
   - Implement currency conversion for cross-market comparisons
   - Add index performance benchmarking

4. ðŸ”„ Implement Machine Learning Models
   - Train models to predict accuracy of different fair value sources
   - Develop a meta-model that optimally weights DCF, analyst, and manual values
   - Create anomaly detection for identifying potential data issues
   - Implement backtesting framework to validate model performance

5. ðŸ”„ Improve User Experience
   - Create a configuration wizard for first-time setup
   - Add a notification system for significant value changes
   - Implement user profiles for different valuation preferences
   - Create report templates for different analysis scenarios

6. ðŸ”„ Enhance Documentation
   - Create comprehensive API documentation using Sphinx
   - Add flow diagrams explaining the system architecture
   - Create video tutorials for common workflows
   - Add detailed examples of custom DCF parameter adjustments

## Completed Enhancements

1. âœ… Refactor FAIR_VALUE_ESTIMATES storage
   - Moved FAIR_VALUE_ESTIMATES from aex_scanner.py to fair_values_config.json
   - Implemented automatic loading mechanism in aex_scanner.py via config_manager.py
   - Created dedicated configuration management with validation
   - Added support for multiple data sources:
     - Manual values (highest priority)
     - DCF calculation values
     - Yahoo Finance analyst targets
   - Implemented priority system for fair value sources

2. âœ… Calculate simplified DCF model as a Python function
   - Implemented DCF calculation based on:
     - Current free cash flow
     - Expected growth rate
     - Discount rate (WACC)
     - Terminal growth rate
   - Added this as an alternative fair value source
   - Implemented multiple valuation methods for different company types:
     - FCF-based DCF for normal companies
     - Earnings-based valuation for financial stocks
     - Price-to-Book valuation as fallback for financial stocks
     - P/E multiple as last resort fallback
   - Added integration with AEX scanner via dcf_integration.py
   - Added report generation capabilities

3. âœ… Implement robust error handling for Yahoo Finance API
   - Added exponential backoff with jitter for rate limiting
   - Implemented automatic retries for connection issues
   - Added comprehensive data validation
   - Created detailed error logging and reporting
   - Built a diagnostic tool (`validate_ticker.py`) for troubleshooting

4. âœ… Create a single source of truth for AEX stock tickers
   - Ticker data is now stored in amsterdam_aex_tickers.csv with tickers.json as backup
   - All modules read from this common data source via aex_tickers.py
   - Ensures consistent ticker lists across the application
   - Simplifies adding/removing stocks from the scanner

5. âœ… Remove hardcoded file paths from JSON files
   - Removed filepath comments from tickers.json
   - Updated update_tickers.py to not add filepath comments
   - Ensured all modules use relative paths consistently

6. âœ… Investigate ticker validation errors in update_tickers.py
   - Replaced TICKER_SPECIAL_CASES with direct data from Euronext
   - Added new test_ticker_validation.py tool for comprehensive testing
   - Enhanced validation with improved retry logic
   - Updated documentation with troubleshooting steps

7. âœ… Investigate possibility to download fair value estimates for free
   - Implemented fair_value_updater.py to use Yahoo Finance analyst targets
   - Integrated automated updates for fair values in aex_scanner.py
   - Created backup mechanisms for fair value data

8. âœ… Refactor ticker management to use a single source of truth
   - Made `amsterdam_aex_tickers.csv` the primary source for ticker data
   - Configured `tickers.json` as a backup source only
   - Enhanced error handling and diagnostics in `aex_tickers.py`
   - Updated all modules to use the centralized ticker management system

9. âœ… Fix ticker validation and special case handling
   - Removed `TICKER_SPECIAL_CASES` mappings from `update_tickers.py`
   - Modified validation logic to rely on Euronext data directly
   - Updated documentation with the new approach

10. âœ… Improve ticker validation testing capabilities
    - Refactored `test_ticker_validation.py` to accept command line parameters
    - Added `--all` parameter to test all tickers from CSV file
    - Added `--verbose` option to show detailed ticker information
    - Added `--wait` parameter to control delay between API calls
    - Improved output formatting with success/failure summaries
